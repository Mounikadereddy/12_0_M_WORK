    Dear Mr. Chowdhury:
    </p>

    <p>
    We made a decision on your claim for additional benefits for your dependents received on date of claim e.g. November 11, 2011.  
    </p>


    <p>
    This letter tells you what we decided, how we made our decision and the evidence used to decide your claim.  We have also included information about what to do if you disagree with our decision, and who to contact if you have questions or need assistance.
    </p>

    <span class="section">
     Your Award Amount and Payment Change Date
    </span>

    <p>
    Your monthly payment amount is shown below:
    </p>
    
    
    <table class="table">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>
                    Monthly Award Amount
                </th>
                <th>

            </table>
    
      <h2>
            You Can Expect Payment
      </h2>
            <p>         
                Your payment begins the first day of the month following your effective date.  You will receive a payment covering the initial amount due under this award, minus any withholdings, in approximately 15 days.  Payment will then be made at the beginning of each month for the prior month.  For example, benefits due for May are paid on or about June 1.
            </p>
            <h2 class="section'">What We Decided</h2>
            <p>
                We are paying you as a veteran with "3" dependent(s).  Your payment includes an additional amount for your spouse "spouse name" and your child(ren) "child name1" and "child name 2".  Let us know right away if there is any change in the status of your dependents.
            </p>                            
      
        <h2>
